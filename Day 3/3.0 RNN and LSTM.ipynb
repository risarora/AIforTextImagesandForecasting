    "Neural Networks also learn and remember what they have learnt, that's how it predicts classes or values for new datasets, but what makes RNN’s different is that unlike normal Neural Networks, RNNs rely on the information from previous output to predict for the upcoming data/input. This feature becomes extremely useful when dealing with sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest application of RNN is in Natural Language Processing. In all natural languages, the order of the words is important to convey the meaning in the right context. When it comes to predicting the next word of a sentence, the network must be familiar with what had come before the word it must predict. RNN can deal with any sequential data, including time series, video or audio sequences etc."

    "So we know that RNNs are capable of remembering the characteristics of previous inputs and outputs. But for how long can it remember. For certain cases, the immediate previous output may not just be enough to predict what's coming and the network may have to rely on information from a further previous output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the phrase “the green grass” and a sentence “I live in France and I can speak French”. To predict the bold word in the first phrase, RNN can rely on its immediate previous output of green, on the other hand, to predict “french”, the Network has to overlook an output that is further away. This is called long-term dependency. Unfortunately as that gap between the words grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long Short Term Memory or LSTM networks are a special kind of RNNs that deals with the long term dependency problem effectively. LSTM networks have a repeating module that has 4 different neural network layers interacting to deal with the long term dependency problem. You can read in detail about LSTM Networks here"
